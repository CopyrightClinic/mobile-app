# Flutter Development Rules

## Localization
- All user-facing strings MUST be localized using the app's localization system
- Never hardcode strings directly in widgets or UI components
- Use AppStrings constants or localization keys for all text content
- Add new strings to the appropriate translation files (e.g., assets/translations/en-US.json)
- Update AppStrings constants when adding new localized content

## Code Style
- Never add comments to code
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
- Keep code clean and readable without explanatory comments
